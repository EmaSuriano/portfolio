A few weeks ago I published my first starter for Gatsby and I want to share some tips I learn along the whole experience.

As many starters in Gatsby, it began as a Personal portfolio. After I published it and share it on Twitter, people asked me if it was Open Source or published somewhere. My reaction at the beginning was saying **No**, but after more inquires came I changed my answer to a _Maybe it will!_.
