name: Runtime Types Validation in Typescript
description: |
  Sometimes using types inside our application, it's not enough to make sure that
  it won't break on runtime. Because of that, we see ourselves forced to write
  validation for our entities manually. In this talk, I want to present a way that
  you can generate validators for all your types in your application automatically,
  and how to integrate this into your development workflow.
