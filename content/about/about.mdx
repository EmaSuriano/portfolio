I was born and raised in Buenos Aires 🇦🇷 but after finishing my studies in Software Engineer I decided to leave my country and moved to Europe to find new challenges in life, which led me to Berlin 🇩🇪!

I started my career as a Developer around 2014 and one lesson I learned from this journey is: _New and better things come out of sharing ideas with others_. To fulfill this:

- I became an [Open Source Developer 👨‍💻](https://github.com/EmaSuriano), creating some [Projects](#projects) on the way, as well as, contributing to several Open Source Communities.
- I started [writing ✍️](/blog) about my passion: Open Source projects I published, fun facts about the Javascript ecosystem or simply taking a hard concept and explained it using simple words.
- I stood on the stage and gave [talks 🎤](/talks) to the public about what I’ve been working on during the last few months.

While I’m not coding you can find me cooking delicious meals at home 👨‍🍳, traveling around the Globe 🌍 or taking pictures and sharing them with the Community on [Unsplash 📸](https://unsplash.com/@emasuriano).
