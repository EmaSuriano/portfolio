I started my career as a Software Developer around 2014 and one lesson I learned through this journey is:
**_New and better things come out of sharing ideas with others_**. To fulfill this:

- I became an Open Source Developer 👨‍💻 on [Github](https://github.com/EmaSuriano), sharing with the community quite a bunch of [cool projects](/oss) on the way, as well as, contributing to several Open Source Projects.
- I started my own [Tech Blog ✍️](/blog) where I write about projects I've working one, fun facts about Javascript or taking a hard concept and explain it without buzzwords. You can also find my writings in other platforms such as [Medium](https://medium.com/@emasuriano) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/emasuriano).
- I stood on the stage and gave [Talks 🎤](/talks) about what I’ve been working on during the last few months. Some of them are uploaded inside my [YouTube channel ▶️](https://www.youtube.com/c/EmaSuriano).

While I’m not coding you can find me cooking delicious meals at Home 👨‍🍳, sharing my thoughts in my [Non-Tech Blog ☮](https://write.as/emasuriano/) or traveling around and taking pictures on [Unsplash 📸](https://unsplash.com/@emasuriano).
