Hi there, my name is Emanuel (Ema) Suriano, and here are some facts about me:

- I'm a Software Engineer at [Revolut](https://revolut.com/), and also maintainer of some Open-Source projects at [Github](https://github.com/EmaSuriano).
- I like to share my discoveries and learning with others, by posting new content in my [Blog](/blog) or [speaking](/talks) in local meetups or conferences.
- While Iâ€™m not coding I tend to share my thoughts in my [Non-Tech Blog](https://write.as/emasuriano/) or spending endless hours in the kitchen cooking.

In case you want to get in touch with me, you can reach out to me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/emasuriano).
