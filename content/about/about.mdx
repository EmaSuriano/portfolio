I come from Buenos Aires 🇦🇷 but after finishing my master in Software Engineer I decided to leave my country and come to Europe to find new challenges in life, which took me to Berlin 🇩🇪!

I started my carrier as a Developer around 2014 and one thing I learned from this journey is: _New and better things come out of sharing ideas with others_. To fulfill this I:

- Became an [Open Source Developer 👨‍💻](https://github.com/EmaSuriano), developing some [Projects](#projects) on the way and contributing to several Open Source Communities.
- Start to [write ✍️](/blog) about my passion: Projects I published, interesting concepts or just explaining hard concepts in simple terms.
- Stand on the stage and give [talks 🎤](/talks) to the public about what I've been working on.

While I'm not coding you can find me cooking delicious meals at home 👨‍🍳, backpacking to a new Country 🎒 or taking pictures and sharing them openly with the Community on [Unsplash 📸](https://unsplash.com/@emasuriano).
