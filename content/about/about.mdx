I started my career as a Software Developer around 2014 and this journey I learn that
**_New and better things come out of sharing ideas with others_**. To fulfill this:

- I became an Open Source Developer on [Github](https://github.com/EmaSuriano), sharing with the community some of my personal work so then others can use them as a base for their ideas or as a a future inspiration, as well as, contributing to several Open Source Projects.
- I started my own [Tech Blog](/blog) where I write about projects I've working on, new frameworks in the Javascript world and why I think they or taking a hard concept and explain it without _buzzwords_.
- I stood on the stage and gave [Talks](/talks) about what I’ve been working on during the last few months. Some of them are uploaded inside my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/EmaSuriano).

While I’m not coding I tend to share my thoughts in my [Non-Tech Blog](https://write.as/emasuriano/) or spending endless hours in the kitchen cooking.
