I was born and raised in Buenos Aires 🇦🇷, but in 2018 I decided to leave my country and look for new challenges in Europe, which led me to Berlin 🇩🇪!

I started my career as a Developer around 2014 and one lesson I learned from this journey is: _New and better things come out of sharing ideas with others_. To fulfill this:

- I became an Open Source Developer 👨‍💻 on [Github](https://github.com/EmaSuriano), releasing quite a bunch of [cool projects](/oss) on the way, as well as, contributing to several Open Source Communities.
- I started my own [Tech Blog ✍️](/blog) where I tend to write about: projects I built, fun facts about the Javascript ecosystem or simply taking a hard concept and explained it using simple words. My writings are available on other platforms such as [Medium](https://medium.com/@emasuriano) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/emasuriano).
- I stood on the stage and gave [Talks 🎤](/talks) about what I’ve been working on during the last few months.

While I’m not coding you can find me cooking delicious meals at home 👨‍🍳, writing in my [Non-Tech Blog ☮](https://write.as/emasuriano/), traveling around the Globe and taking pictures and sharing them with the Community on [Unsplash 📸](https://unsplash.com/@emasuriano).
