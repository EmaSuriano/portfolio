Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mate a gatsby starter which is focus on simplicity and extensibility. It's build with Gatsby(duh), [Rebass](https://jxnblk.com/rebass/) (styled-component system) and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/).

The starter provides 4 customizable sections:

- [Landing:](#home) Displays a nice greeting with your name, also your roles (what you are) and all your social links.
- [About:](#about) Show the about section where you can write about who you are, what you like to do, etc. Also you can add a photo next to it!
- [Project:](#projects) Displays a card for all your project that you've made and also the posibility to link with github or and external link.
- [Writting:](#writting) Take the information about your medium user and show up to 6 stories as cards with the link to Medium.

In case you want to have your own instance of this Starter, check the [Github repository](https://github.com/EmaSuriano/gatsby-starter-mate)! It's free ðŸ˜„
