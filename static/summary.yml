  - name: Runtime Types Validation in Typescript
    description: |
      Sometimes using types inside our application, it's not enough to make sure that
      it won't break on runtime. Because of that, we see ourselves forced to write
      validation for our entities manually. In this talk, I want to present a way that
      you can generate validators for all your types in your application automatically,
      and how to integrate this into your development workflow.
