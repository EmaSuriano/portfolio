I'm an [Open Source Developer](https://github.com/EmaSuriano), sharing with the community some of my personal work so then others can use them as a base for their ideas or as a a future inspiration, as well as, contributing to several [Open Source Projects](#projects).

I like to share my discoveries and learning with others, by posting new content in my [Blog](/blog) or [speaking](#talks) in many local meetups and conferences about web development.

While Iâ€™m not coding I tend to share my thoughts in my [Non-Tech Blog](https://write.as/emasuriano/).
