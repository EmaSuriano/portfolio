First of all, happy new 2023 for everybody reading this and welcome to the new version of my website! It took some time to set it up, between the breaks of work and some weekends while playing around the new stack. The idea of the article is to share my insights about why I decided to fully re-built it and some other improvements I made on top of the journey.

My old website was powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a very popular Static website generator. The part that attracted me the most about it, was the whole [JAM Stack](https://jamstack.org/) architecture: the idea of decoupling the data loading and the application logic. Having as a result a fully static website without any loader if everything was fetched during _build time_.

I kept in a separate branch the previous website, to have it as a _memento_ and also to come back at any point if there was something that I didn't migrate yet. You can access the older version by clicking the below image.

## What was the problem before?

Topics that I want to cover:

- Close this topic, saying that the Gatsby novela got discontinued, and therefore the project became harder and harder to maintain. At the end was a big cluttered project with old technology. Yes 2 years, it's a lot.
- What is this new website about?
  - Why Astro? Still a static website
  - Focus on less JS, and more UX. Making as lightest as possible
  - MOving away from CSS-in-JS to Tailwind.
  - Fully framework agnostic: no React, no Angular, no Vue. Only Astro.
  - Adopting Large Media setup for images https://docs.netlify.com/large-media/setup/
  - Closing with the idea of: the more control you have over your project, the better it can scaled.
