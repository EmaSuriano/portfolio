One of my goals for this year is to come back to the times when I was contributing more, which was around the time that I launched my previous website with the blog included. It was a huge improvement over the other one that I had, and made me realized the importance of having a presentable website for anyone who is looking for you over the web.

My old website was powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a very popular Static website generator. The part that attracted me the most about it, was the whole [JAM Stack](https://jamstack.org/) architecture: the idea of decoupling the data loading and the application logic. Having as a result a fully static website without any loader if everything was fetched during _build time_.

I kept in a separate branch the previous website, to have it as a memento and also to come back at any point if there was something that I didn't migrate. You can check out the legacy website [here]().

## What was the problem before?

Topics that I want to cover:

- Close this topic, saying that the Gatsby novela got discontinued, and therefore the project became harder and harder to maintain. At the end was a big cluttered project with old technology. Yes 2 years, it's a lot.
- What is this new website about?
  - Why Astro? Still a static website
  - Focus on less JS, and more UX. Making as lightest as possible
  - MOving away from CSS-in-JS to Tailwind.
  - Fully framework agnostic: no React, no Angular, no Vue. Only Astro.
  - Adopting Large Media setup for images https://docs.netlify.com/large-media/setup/
  - Closing with the idea of: the more control you have over your project, the better it can scaled.
