# About Me

Hi there, my name is Emanuel (Ema) Suriano.

I'm an Open Source Developer, sharing with the community some of my personal work so then others can use them as a base for their ideas or as a a future inspiration, as well as, contributing to several Open Source Projects.

I like to share my discoveries and learning with others, by posting new content in my [Blog](/blog) or speaking in many local meetups and conferences about.

While Iâ€™m not coding I tend to share my thoughts in my [Non-Tech Blog](https://write.as/emasuriano/) or spending endless hours in the kitchen cooking.
