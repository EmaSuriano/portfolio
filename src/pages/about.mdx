<h1>About me</h1>

I'm an Open Source Developer, sharing with the community some of my personal work so then others can use them as a base for their ideas or as a a future inspiration, as well as, contributing to several Open Source Projects.

I like to share my discoveries and learning with others, by posting new content in my [Blog](/blog) or speaking in many local meetups and conferences about.

While Iâ€™m not coding I tend to share my thoughts in my [Non-Tech Blog](https://write.as/emasuriano/) or spending endless hours in the kitchen cooking.
