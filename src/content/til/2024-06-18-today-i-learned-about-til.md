As the title says, today I learned about the concept of Today I Learned, or TIL for the friends. It's some sort of micro-blogging where you create posts that are less than 200 words and that have only one goal, sharing one little and normally quite specific thing without entering into broader topics.

Besides the main goal did not change: **Sharing knowledge to the public in written form**. What I like about this new way of writing is the simplicity and short amount of time that one post required. With this I'm not saying that the quality is going to get worse, it's just simply easier to ship shorter articles.

A big drawback that I constantly see about writing long articles is that they require the writer to prepare some pre-requirement for the reader to first understand what you want to share, to later introduce the topic or the problem to solve, and finally reach a conclusion for it. This structure demands a lot from the writer: you might have to cross-check your references or even dig deep into documentation, and this is why it's so hard to write a good quality article weekly or even monthly (if writing is not your main job) ...

I already exceeded the limit of 200 words, but I wanted to give a quick summary of why I started a separate "blog" section called TIL.

Thanks for reading
