Around one week since Google published [this article](https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-audio-overviews/), where they shared a very interesting feature inside a well known platform called [Notebook LLM](https://notebooklm.google/). They call it `Audio Overview` and it allows anyone to generate an audible podcast between two host in English from any of your documents.

When I tried it, I was blown away by the quality of the sound and how human-like it sounds. Also, the way the hosts approach the topics tends to be very friendly approach and easy to understand for anyone, in many times even creating analogies and references to topics that were not mention in the official document.

Because of this, I started a new experimental podcast in [my website](https://emasuriano.com/podcast) with the new topics I'm currently learning while doing my AI studies. The new episodes are going to be about Machine Learning, so in case you are curious about these topics you are more than welcome to stay around.

PD: I also took the liberty to publish the podcast to [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/7hba19unhTLNTFXnTf0T9T), just for fun, and also because I know that many people listen to podcast in that platform (me included!).
