## Managing Time and Priorities

If you're like me, balancing a job and maintaining open source projects can be quite a challenge. It can be tough to manage your time effectively and set priorities when you have deadlines, meetings, and other work-related tasks looking for your attention alongside pull requests, and issues popping out for your beloved open source projects.

Especially when you have multiple open source projects under your wing, the task can become even more daunting. Each project requires its own time and attention, and it can be overwhelming to keep up with the demands of multiple projects simultaneously.

I've tried using schedules and to-do lists to stay organized, but let's face it, it's not always a piece of cake. Saying no or delegating tasks when needed and communicating my availability and commitments to my team, contributors, and the community has been crucial, but I'm still learning to strike the right balance between my job and open source contributions.

Thankfully, technology has come to the rescue! I've been able to leverage project management tools, productivity apps, and automation tools to streamline tasks, automate repetitive processes, and optimize my workflow. However, I've also realized that it's important to regularly review my schedule, tasks, and commitments, and make necessary adjustments to ensure that I am effectively managing my time and priorities.
